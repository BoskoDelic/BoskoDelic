# Hello! :hand:
## I'm Bo≈°ko, here is some basic info about me:

- I'm studying Computer science at the *University of Belgrade*. :serbia:
- I'm into various different programming areas, ***currently*** learning DevOps.
- Here are some languages I've worked with:

Since studying Computer science requires doing many different projects, I decided to pin some interesting ones here, not just for others but also for myself in the future.

## Currently working on... :construction_worker:
- Expanding knowledge of DevOps tools like Docker and AWS
- Developing personal projects
